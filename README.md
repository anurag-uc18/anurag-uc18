## 🎬 Recently Watched  

When I’m not wrangling data and shipping code, you’ll probably find me diving into movies.  
Here’s a peek at my recent watchlist (because GitHub Pages isn’t just for commits 😉):  

2025-10-02 🧊 *Bone Lake (2025)* — 10/10 for atmosphere, 0/10 for making me want to go near any lake ever again.
2025-10-07 🪐 *The Martian (2015)* - Exciting and exhilirating.

*(This list updates as I keep watching and adding more – consider it my cinematic changelog.)*
